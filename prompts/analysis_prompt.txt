I've uploaded two images: "${IMAGE_A}" and "${IMAGE_B}".

Here are the psychic impressions for one of these images:

${IMPRESSIONS}

Please analyze these impressions and determine which image ("${IMAGE_A}" or "${IMAGE_B}") they most closely match.
Based on this analysis, choose the image that best matches the impressions. Bear in mind that the impression may describe only one aspect or section of the target image.
Explain your reasoning, noting specific details from the impressions that correspond to elements in the chosen image.
Respond via a JSON object with the following format:
{
  "chosen_image": "${IMAGE_A} or ${IMAGE_B}",
  "reasoning": "Explanation of reasoning"
}
